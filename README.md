# 🐢 Turtle Race Game using Python

This is a simple and fun "Python-based turtle race game" built using the `turtle` graphics package.
The game allows users to guess which colored turtle will win the race as they move across the screen at random distances.

## 🎮 Description

The game features:
- Six turtles, each of a unique color.
- A user input prompt to guess which turtle will win.
- Turtles start from the left edge of the screen and move forward with random step sizes (using Python's `random` module).
- The first turtle to reach the right edge of the screen is declared the "winner".
- A result message is displayed to let the user know if their guess was "correct or incorrect".

This project is implemented using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles with a `Screen` class and turtle instances.
